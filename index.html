                    <p>I am Rachel. I am exceedingly sarcastic, to the point where most people think I'm odd, rude, or overall serious. I am not.</p> 
                    
                    <p>I was born and raised in San Diego. I attended unremarkable schools and did nothing of amazing value throughout my life. I used to draw a lot of cartoons as a child, although, I have fallen out of that in recent years. I took some community college classes, including multiple math classes that I took for fun. But I really hit gold when I took a set building class for theatre.</p>
                    
                    <div id="set-box">
                    
                        <img id="set-design" src="assets/images/set-design.jpg" alt="Set Design">

                        <p>A set I helped build for "The Taming of the Shrew"</p>

                    </div>

                    <p>I really enjoyed the carpentry of the class and quickly became a regular of the class and a favorite of the teachers. I ended up taking all versions of the class (Sets I, Sets II, Sets III, etc) for a total of 3 years before I had to abandon the class for a full-time job. In that time, I worked on 13 different shows including well-known shows like 'The Odd Couple', 'A Street Car Named Desire', and 'Rommeo and Juliet' and lesser-known shows like 'These Shining Lives', 'Kimberly Akimbo', and 'The Piano Lesson'. I also worked on one summer conservatory show, 'Cinderella: The Musical', which was one of the largest sets I helped build there, having several 20-foot-tall flats (set terminology for walls), that each had to be installed individually.</p>

                    <p>Nowadays, my days are mostly unextraoridinary, consisting of work, then home. The only thing I really do for fun is gaming. I play online PC games with a set group of gaming friends I have made over the past year or so. We play all sorts of games, but tend to stick to select few.</p>

                    <p>Those being Rainbow 6 Siege, a first-person competitive shooter, where you can pick between 20+ different characters, on either attack or defense, with specific special gadgets which can perform a variety of different tasks. World of Warcraft, a well-known MMO RPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game). And Sea of Thieves, another MMO that has you aboard a pirate ship, plundering treasures of all kinds with really the only end-game being to buy more aesthetics to make yourself even more fly. That's it. I have a pretty unremarkable bio. Thanks for bearing through it.</p>
